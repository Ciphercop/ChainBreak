# Illicit Transaction Detector - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Illicit Transaction Detector is a comprehensive system designed to identify suspicious cryptocurrency transaction patterns and assess risk levels for blockchain addresses. This system combines graph theory, machine learning, and threat intelligence to detect various illicit activities such as money laundering, mixing services, and other suspicious patterns.

## Core Architecture

    tx_hash: str          # Unique transaction identifier
    from_address: str     # Source wallet address
    to_address: str       # Destination wallet address
    value: float         # Transaction amount in BTC
    timestamp: datetime   # When the transaction occurred
    block_height: Optional[int] = None
    fee: Optional[float] = None
    confirmations: Optional[int] = None
```

**Purpose**: Represents individual cryptocurrency transactions with all relevant metadata.

#### `AddressNode` Class
```python
@dataclass
class AddressNode:
    address: str                                    # Wallet address
    total_received: float = 0.0                    # Total BTC received
    total_sent: float = 0.0                        # Total BTC sent
    transaction_count: int = 0                      # Number of transactions
    first_seen: Optional[datetime] = None          # First transaction time

```

**Purpose**: Represents wallet addresses as nodes in the transaction graph with comprehensive metadata for analysis.

## Core Detection Algorithms

### 1. Graph Construction (`_build_transaction_graph`)

**Purpose**: Converts raw transaction data into a directed graph structure.

**Algorithm**:
1. Create a NetworkX directed graph
2. Add addresses as nodes
3. Add transactions as weighted edges
4. Aggregate multiple transactions between same addresses
5. Calculate edge weights inversely proportional to transaction value

**Mathematical Foundation**: 
- Graph G = (V, E) where V = addresses, E = transactions
- Edge weight = 1/(value + 1) to prioritize smaller transactions (more suspicious)

### 2. Community Detection (`_detect_communities_louvain`)

**Purpose**: Identifies groups of addresses that frequently transact with each other.

**Algorithm**: Louvain Algorithm
1. Convert directed graph to undirected
2. Apply modularity optimization
3. Group nodes into communities
4. Filter out small communities (< 3 nodes)

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Modularity Q = (1/2m) * Σ[Aij - (ki*kj/2m)] * δ(ci, cj)
- Where m = total edges, Aij = adjacency matrix, ki = degree of node i

### 3. Anomaly Detection (`_detect_anomalies`)

**Purpose**: Identifies addresses with unusual transaction patterns.

**Algorithms**:
1. **Isolation Forest**: Detects outliers using random decision trees
2. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Identifies local density-based outliers

**Feature Vector**: [total_received, total_sent, transaction_count, degree_centrality, betweenness_centrality]

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Isolation Forest: Uses random splits to isolate outliers
- LOF: Compares local density of a point to its neighbors

### 4. Pattern Detection Algorithms

#### Peel Chain Detection (`_detect_peel_chains`)
**Purpose**: Identifies chains of decreasing-value transactions (common in money laundering).

**Algorithm**:
1. Sort transactions by timestamp for each address
2. Look for sequences where each transaction value decreases by >10%
3. Flag sequences with ≥5 transactions

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Peel chain: T1 > T2 > T3 > ... > Tn where Ti+1 < Ti * 0.9

#### Mixing Pattern Detection (`_detect_mixing_patterns`)
**Purpose**: Identifies many-to-many transaction patterns typical of mixing services.

**Algorithm**:
1. Group transactions by time windows (24 hours)
2. Calculate input/output address diversity
3. Flag windows with ≥10 transactions and high diversity

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Mixing score = min(input_addresses, output_addresses) / total_transactions
- Threshold: mixing_score > 0.3

**Purpose**: Identifies suspiciously fast transaction sequences.

**Algorithm**:
1. Find sequences of ≥5 transactions from same address
2. Check if all transactions occur within 60 minutes
3. Flag rapid sequences

#### Round Amount Detection (`_detect_round_amounts`)
**Purpose**: Identifies transactions with suspiciously round amounts.

**Algorithm**:
1. Check if amounts end in many zeros
2. Check against common round amounts (1.0, 10.0, 100.0, etc.)
3. Flag addresses with ≥10 round transactions

#### Smurfing Detection (`_detect_smurfing`)
**Purpose**: Identifies breaking large amounts into many small transactions.

**Algorithm**:
1. Find addresses with ≥20 outgoing transactions
2. Check if transactions are <10% of total value
3. Flag addresses with many small transactions

#### Layering Detection (`_detect_layering`)

### 6. SIR Model Simulation (`_run_sir_simulation`)

**Purpose**: Models the propagation of illicit activity through the network.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- SIR Model: Susceptible → Infected → Recovered
- β = infection rate, γ = recovery rate
- dS/dt = -βSI, dI/dt = βSI - γI, dR/dt = γI
